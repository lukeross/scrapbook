# Retrospectives

I don't personally believe that Scrum-style retrospectives work very well for
most teams. I believe there are two keys problems:

- Confused remit: is it to identify technical issues, process issues, boost
  morale? Trying to cover too many bases means none get fully addressed.

- The "reward" for bringing bad news is typically to take an Action away -
  that is, if things are going badly you are saddled with additional work.
  Even well-meaning people learn to say nothing to avoid this trap.

Possible (totally untested) ideas for more focused retrospectives.

## Identifying and Handing Tech Debt

- Divide a board into "Technical pain-points" and "Wouldn't it be great if".
  The former is to identify technical issues in the sprint that may want
  addressing; the latter to capture refactoring/new-technology ideas.

- Add feedback cards under these headings.

- Group in the usual way.

- Discuss and identify which ones the team supports. Create stories in your
  issue tracker for these, but don't assign them.

- Optionally, groom your tech-debt stories by closing any no longer relevant
  and roughly ordering what remains.

- Take the top 1-3 stories into your next sprint planning as normal pointed
  storied. By giving them points that reserves time for them in the sprint.

## Addressing Team Morale

- Start with 5-10 questions which are the same every time. Questions should
  aim to find out how team members feel about the sprint, with questions
  looking at different aspects of the experience: blockers, overwork,
  lack of skills etc. Each question takes a score from 1 (bad) to 5 (good)

- Possible ideas for questions: "I delivered what I planned to",
  "I feel I delivered quality work", "I was able to get help when I needed it",
  "I was able to focus on my work", "I feel our product is in a good place",
  "I knew how to do what was asked of me".

- Each team member scores each question. The results are tabulated and summed
  for each question, and then in total to form a "sprint score".

- The highest-scoring and lowest-scoring questions are discussed. What made
  the highest-scoring one go well? Why did people score the lowest-scoring
  so poorly? What could be done to make people feel better about it?

- Optionally, compare the question and sprint scores against the last few
  sprints. Are things improving?

- Try to decide on one or two actions to improve the lowest-scoring question,
  perhaps through pairing, distributing work differently or allowing refactor
  time for problem areas. Ideally they should be ideas which either are fed
  into sprint-planning, or else are jointly owned by the team. Occasionally
  they may be "assigned" to one team member, but should be the exception
  rather than the rule.
